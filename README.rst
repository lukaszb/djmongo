``djmongo`` is yet another mongodb_ adapter for Django_. This one however, is
build directly on pymongo_, tries to be as small and simple as possible and
mimics Django_'s ORM (managers/querysets).

``djmongo`` supports Django_ >= 1.3.


Installation
------------

To install ``djmongo`` simply run::

    pip install djmongo

Configuration
-------------

``djmongo`` provides *database engine* so configuration is rather
straight-forward::

    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': 'database.sqlite',
            'TEST_NAME': ':memory:',
        },

        'mongodb': {
            'ENGINE': 'djmongo.backend.mongodb',
            'NAME': 'testdb',
        }
    }

In above example we added ``mongodb`` aliased connection to local mongodb
server.

In your settings you should also provide ``MONGODB_COLLECTIONS_PREFIX`` value.
By default documents would use it as a prefix for all collections. In example
following docuemnt::

    class Item(Document):
        pass

with ``MONGODB_COLLECTIONS_PREFIX`` set to ``develop``.  would have collection
name equal to ``develop.item``.

If you want to override default collection name you should always remember to
use that prefix from settings (only collections with that prefix are dropped
during test run).

Usage
-----

Create a document::

    from djmongo.document import Document
    from django.conf import settings

    class MyDocument(Document):

        class Meta:
            using = 'mongodb'

    doc1 = MyDocument.objects.create(data={'foo': 'bar'})
    doc2 = MyDocument.objects.create(data={'foo': 'baz'})

    ...


Testing
-------

In order to properly test an application, one would like to destroy all objects
inserted during test run between test cases. Normally, Django_ does that using
transactions, however we need to destroy objects manually. One can do that at
*tearDown* method using connection's extra method called
``clear_all_collections``. Alternatively, one can use subclass of Django_'s
``django.test.TestCase``: ``djmongo.test.TestCase``.

Development
-----------

We use github_ for development of this package (repository, issue tracker).
We also use tox_ for package testing against - if one would like to run whole
test suite against all supported Django_ versions, simply *clone* repository and
run ``tox`` command within it (``pip install tox`` if it's missing).
